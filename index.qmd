## From Darkness to Decision {.unnumbered}

> *"Data should not only reveal darkness, but it should also help cities decide where to shine next."*

Philadelphia's nights are unevenly illuminated. Downtown shines brightly, while parts of North Philadelphia and Kensington remain in darkness for weeks after lights fail. This pattern reflects **spatiotemporal inequality** in infrastructure maintenance—where some neighborhoods get rapid repairs and others wait in the dark.

---

# Urban Problem and Motivation

The consequences of unequal lighting are threefold:

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Three Critical Impacts

1. **Objective Risk**: Concentration of street crimes and traffic accidents
2. **Subjective Fear**: Diminished sense of safety and comfort  
3. **Social Inequity**: Low-income and minority areas face higher exposure to lighting poverty
:::

### Research Question

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Core Question
**In what ways does urban lighting influence perceived and actual safety among people navigating Philadelphia at night?**

# Research Goals

Our project pursues four interconnected objectives:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Research Framework"
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(
    node = dict(
      pad = 15,
      thickness = 20,
      line = dict(color = "black", width = 0.5),
      label = ["Lighting Equity", "Light-Safety Links", "Mobility Exposure", 
               "Predictive Models", "Faster Repairs", "Fairer Distribution", 
               "Safer Mobility", "Community Trust"],
      color = ["#1f77b4", "#ff7f0e", "#2ca02c", "#d62728", 
               "#9467bd", "#8c564b", "#e377c2", "#7f7f7f"]
    ),
    link = dict(
      source = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3],
      target = [4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 7, 4],
      value = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  ))])

fig.update_layout(title_text="From Analysis to Impact", font_size=10, height=400)
fig.show()
```

## Goal 1: Quantify Lighting Equity
Measure streetlight outage density, repair delay, and socioeconomic correlates through our **Lighting Equity Index (LEI)**.

## Goal 2: Reveal Light-Safety Mechanisms  
Test links between lighting quality, crime rates, and perceived insecurity using spatial regression models.

## Goal 3: Integrate Mobility Exposure
Evaluate how night transit (SEPTA) and Indego bike networks intersect with lighting coverage via our **Night Transit Exposure Index (NTE)**.

## Goal 4: Predict and Prioritize
Use machine learning (Random Forest) to forecast future 'dark spots' and propose repair corridors.

# Data Sources

Our analysis integrates seven data domains:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-data
#| tbl-cap: "Comprehensive Data Integration"

import pandas as pd

data_dict = {
    'Domain': [
        'Streetlight Maintenance',
        'Public Safety', 
        'Mobility',
        'Socio-Economic',
        'Urban Form',
        'Remote Sensing',
        'Reference Cities'
    ],
    'Dataset': [
        '311 Streetlight Out Reports',
        'Philadelphia Crime Incidents',
        'SEPTA GTFS, Indego Trips',
        'ACS 5-Year Estimates',
        'OSM Road Network, Land Use',
        'VIIRS Nighttime Lights',
        'Chicago, LA, Milan, Copenhagen'
    ],
    'Variables / Purpose': [

        'Benchmark indicators and policy analogs'
    ]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data_dict)
print(df.to_markdown(index=False))
```

## Data Accessibility
All datasets are publicly available through Philadelphia's OpenDataPhilly portal, US Census Bureau, and OpenStreetMap.

# Methodology Overview

Our workflow follows the complete data-science pipeline:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Phase 1: Diagnostics
- Aggregate outages by street segment per quarter
- Compute **Outage Density (OD)** and **Repair Delay (RD)**
- Generate Darkness Evolution Maps

## Phase 2: Equity Analysis
- Standardize OD, RD, poverty, and vehicle ownership
- Derive integrated **Lighting Equity Index (LEI)** via PCA
- Identify lighting poverty hotspots

## Phase 3: Spatial Statistics
- Moran's I and LISA for clustering detection
- Spatial Lag and Error Models
- Quantify crime ~ lighting relationship

## Phase 4: Perception Gap
- Map objective crime vs subjective fear
- Analyze 311 complaint patterns
- Identify perception-reality mismatches

## Phase 5: Mobility Integration
- Compute nighttime SEPTA headways
- Build 10-min walk buffers via OSMnx
- Calculate **Night Transit Exposure Index (NTE)**

## Phase 6: Prediction
- Random Forest on OD/RD, road density, zoning, season
- Generate dark-zone risk probability maps
- Rank priority corridors

## Phase 7: Visualization
- Interactive Panel Dashboard
- Temporal slider and narrative storytelling
- Theme: "From Darkness to Decision"

# The LEIF Framework

Our **Lighting Equity Integrated Framework (LEIF)** connects five key stages:

```{mermaid}

    A[DIAGNOSIS<br/>Spatial & Temporal Inequality] --> B[EXPLANATION<br/>Lighting-Crime-Perception Links]
    B --> C[SIMULATION<br/>Lighting-Transit Interaction]
    C --> D[PREDICTION<br/>Future Dark Zone Forecasts]
    D --> E[ACTION & FEEDBACK<br/>Dashboard & Community Portal]

# Expected Impact

Our project aims to deliver measurable improvements across four dimensions:

::: {.callout-success icon=false}
## Transformation Goals

**Operational Efficiency**  
Faster repairs and smarter allocation of maintenance resources

**Distributional Justice**  
Fairer distribution of lighting infrastructure across neighborhoods

**Public Safety**  
Safer nighttime mobility along key transit corridors

**Civic Engagement**  
Strengthened community trust through transparent dashboards
:::

---

# Why This Matters

Every streetlight outage represents more than a technical failure—it reflects a gap in the urban social contract. When repairs take weeks in some neighborhoods and days in others, we're not just seeing infrastructure inequality; we're witnessing the compounding of disadvantage.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## The Equity Imperative
Low-income communities already face higher crime rates, limited transit options, and fewer private vehicles. Prolonged darkness adds another layer of vulnerability, constraining mobility, economic opportunity, and quality of life.
:::

By transforming 311 maintenance data into actionable insight, we demonstrate how **spatial data science can illuminate pathways to justice**—one streetlight at a time.
