    "text": "From Darkness to Decision\n\n“Data should not only reveal darkness, but it should also help cities decide where to shine next.”\n\nPhiladelphia’s nights are unevenly illuminated. Downtown shines brightly, while parts of North Philadelphia and Kensington remain in darkness for weeks after lights fail. This pattern reflects spatiotemporal inequality in infrastructure maintenance—where some neighborhoods get rapid repairs and others wait in the dark.",
